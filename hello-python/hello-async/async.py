    # The five steps to async code:
    # 1. Use a library that has async functions. Here we use asyncio.sleep(), but it could be something like openAI's async version of their API call.
    # 2. Put `await` in front of the async function call. 
    #    This is special in two ways: First, it is blocking within it's function, so nothing runs after `await` in that function until that line completes.
    #    Second, it is non-blocking for any other async function outside the definition. `await` is the point in the code where it gives back control to the event loop.
    # 3. Put `async` in front of any function that has an `await` in it.
    # 4. `asyncio.run()` is required to call any function with `async` in front of it.
    # 5. `asyncio.gather()` is required to get any benefit from async. It allows you to run multiple async functions at once. Wrap it in an async helper function to use it.
